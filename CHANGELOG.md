# Changelog

All notable changes to `rote` (distributed on PyPI as
[`rote-cli`](https://pypi.org/project/rote-cli/)) are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While `rote` is pre-1.0, minor versions may include breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- MCP-backed `external_call` nodes: an IR `mcp:` binding (server / tool /
  args / url / transport) lets a graduated pipeline **call the MCP tool
  the source skill used, over Streamable HTTP**, instead of emitting a
  `NotImplementedError` stub — so the output runs out of the box. The DBOS
  adapter emits a working FastMCP client call by default
  (`external_backend="mcp"`); `api` falls back to the direct-SDK `impl`.
  Verified end-to-end against a live mock MCP server (`tests/test_mcp_e2e.py`).
- `rote eval` harness: an auto-emitted `scorecard.md` with a static
  before/after estimate of speed, cost, and determinism (live-fetched
  model prices, no hardcoded tables), plus `rote eval --run` for
  empirical trials of both the source skill and the emitted pipeline.
- Open-source project scaffolding: CI on every pull request and push
  (Python 3.11–3.13 matrix + lint/type/sanity gates), `SECURITY.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, this changelog, issue/PR templates, Dependabot,
  and a pre-commit config.

### Fixed
- Corrected `pip install rote[...]` → `rote-cli[...]` across the docs
  (the bare `rote` name is an unrelated PyPI package).
- Refreshed stale version/adapter/test-count references in the README,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the BDR example README.

## [0.5.0]

### Added
- **Inngest adapter** (`inngest`): emits a TypeScript Inngest app that
  mounts into an existing Node/Next.js service, with `waitForEvent`
  HITL gates.
- **Raw Python adapter** (`python`): a maximum-legibility,
  orchestrator-free plain-script target; refuses `hitl_gate` pipelines
  at emit time.
- DBOS trigger backend for `rote serve`, so the default runtime can be
  MCP-triggered.

## [0.4.0]

### Added
- **DBOS TypeScript adapter** (`dbos-ts`): a zero-infrastructure
  durable target for Node shops (shares `_ts_common` with Cloudflare).

### Changed
- **DBOS is now the default runtime.**

### Security
- Hardened the IR and every emitter against code injection from crafted
  `pipeline.yaml` input (charset-constrained id/signal/impl fields at
  the IR boundary; escaped prose at emission).

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- **Cloudflare Workflows adapter** (`cloudflare`) — the second runtime,
  proving the IR is runtime-agnostic — and the **DBOS adapter**.
- `rote serve` / `rote register`: expose graduated pipelines as MCP
  tools (FastMCP 3.x, stdio + Streamable HTTP).
- Data-flow threading: nodes declare `inputs:` and adapters thread real
  payloads through the DAG.
- `rote` shipped as a Claude Code plugin.

### Changed
- Distribution renamed to `rote-cli` on PyPI (import and CLI stay
  `rote`); package made release-ready with tag-driven Trusted
  Publishing.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial release: the runtime-agnostic IR (`pipeline.yaml`), the
  Temporal adapter, the graduator agent + driver layer (Claude,
  Anthropic API, Codex stub), the `rote graduate` / `rote emit` CLI,
  and the BDR-outreach example skill.
